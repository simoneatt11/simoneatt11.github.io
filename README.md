### To Do


### Forked from
A Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.
- I used [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right.
- and followed [this tutorial] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lJhXJCUYCc&t=320s) from Boris, with some minor changes.
