üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Currently I'm working at the Ecole Polytechnique de Bruxelles in the laboratory of Fabrizio Pucci and Marianne Rooman. 

üìö My work currently focuses on the devolpment of a predictor for protein solubility upon single mutations leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks. 

üìΩÔ∏è In my free time, I am passionate about making science accessible and engaging. Most recently, I contributed to the Machine Learning 4 Non Globular Proteins [Machine Learning 4 Non Globular Proteins](https://ml4ngp.eu/) project by producing interviews. This exciting initiative applies artificial intelligence and machine learning to study Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs), which play crucial roles in biological processes but are less understood due to their unstructured nature.

Twist and Shout: The Unexpected Turns of My Research Path
======
My scientific career starts in South Italy, in Bari. There my passion for turtles and dolphins (characteristic in my city, Taranto) led me to study Biological sciences. 
In one of the last exams, I discovered the critical role of mitochondria in brain health and disease, particularly how they are affected in conditions like Parkinson‚Äôs Disease. This moment reshaped my scientific pursuits, leading me deeper into the molecular neurobiology and neuroscience.

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
