### Visualizing proteins here

Is representation of protein useful? 
Should we know how proteins we work with are represented into the three dimensional space? 
Are the information coming from structural biologists relevant for wet biologists? 

Tubulin is one of the first proteins I entered in contact with during my career. I thought it could be a good idea to show how to achieve a representation similar to this one. 
At the end of this post you can also find a script that can automatically take your PDB file and generate the high-quality image you may need.
