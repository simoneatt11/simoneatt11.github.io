### Writing time

I finally started (seriously) to write my PhD thesis.
On this series of posts I will document my process of writing, sharing my struggles and difficulties. 
Writing a thesis doesn't have to be hard, but indeed, is being one of the hardest things of my life. Not because is difficult, but because meanwhile there are millions of things that seem more urgent and necessary... Finding a new job, studying, moving around, trying to get my papers published and so on. 
After 6 months passed by wasting overall a great amount of time, I thought a public diary might be a good exercise to avoid extreme loss of time - still there is going to be some time wasted in having a proper github page, like people watching videos if they don't fall asleep about "how to fall asleep. 
This series of posts might be a good parallel- how to write a thesis without writing a thesis.
