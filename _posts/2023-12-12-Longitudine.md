Book: Longitude - The true Story of a Lone Genius who solved the greatest scientific Problem of his time
Author: Dava Sobel

I decided to pick this book after listening Andrew Huberman's podcast, where he interviewied Robert Greene. You can listen the full episode [here]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=1s)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=1s), book suggestion @ minute 6:40.

Don't ask me why, but in Italian the subtitle changes into: "How a lone genius changed the history of navigation". I find this translation in italian even more appropriate than the original one, in english. The inventions we will talk about changed the story of navigation, and also the story of the world. 

### Can't we just use Google Maps?!

Back in the XV century people couldn't use google maps on their Iphone. They had to use beautiful hand drawn maps, correlated with the necessary notations.
Parallels and meridians define latitude and longitude of every living person in the world (you included). The biggest difference is that parallels are different to each others, meridians are all identical spanning from one pole to the opposite one. The parallel with latitude 0 is the Equator, the meridian with longitude 0 is the one passing from Greenwich.

The problem of positioning yourself was even worst if you were into the ocean. Though you can easily calculate the latitude using the Sun and some reference stars, it's very difficult to calculate the longitude, especially if you don't know _exactly_ what time is it. People would have been waiting still half millenium for Google Maps on their phone, however only one century was separating them from the chronometer and the possibility of knowing the exact latitude.

### The longitude Act 1714

keep writing ...

- is this a big problem? 20k for who found the solution to the longitude problem
- 2000 people died the 22 Oct 1707
- the problem of long navigation and Scurvy - America discovered 1492
- Ignorance led to death of people, lost of richness and of power. 
- Longitude was already a problem for Galileo - celatone
- How moon and other planets are moving around the Sun - Galileo ans Newton
- Galileo and the first pendulum looking a candle in a church - Huygens built it
- Huygens said would have been good for longitude calculations p.43
